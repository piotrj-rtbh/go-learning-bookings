To get aliases working in Powershell you can use a function inside of your Powershell profile. 
I like the new Windows Terminal so that is what I am using in the pictures.

If you execute $Profile in your terminal you will get the location of your Powershell profile.
> $Profile
C:\Users\Piotr Jaworski\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

You need to edit that file and append the following(you can change the function name to whatever you like):

function coverage {
    go test -coverprofile coverage.out 
    go tool cover -html coverage.out
}

You then need to restart your terminal and then you can run the alias!
