1. create database.yml according to https://gobuffalo.io/documentation/database/configuration/
  change db name, passwords etc.
2. run (https://gobuffalo.io/documentation/database/migrations/#writing-migrations)
  soda generate fizz CreateUserTable
3. https://gobuffalo.io/documentation/database/fizz/#create-a-table
    copy the create table migration to .up. migration
    and change the fields to match our project
4. at the rott level of the project run:
  soda migrate    

5. Down migration - reverses changes:
eg. sql("drop table ...")

6. creating a foreign key table for Reservations (room_id will be the foreign key)
soda generate fizz CreateFKForReservationsTable
7. creating another FKs: 
for RoomRestrictions table we have 2 FKs: room_id and restriction_id
soda generate fizz CreateFKForRoomRestrictions
8. adding unique index for Users table - on email (we don't want to create multiple users with same email)
 soda generate fizz CreateUniqueIndexForUsersTable

 For down-migrations - dropping index or a foreign key - we have to look how the indexes are named in the DB:
 DBweaver: table --> Indexes / Foreign Keys

 9. adding start_date and end_date as index (for quick lookup) on this pair and other indexes: on room_id and reservation_id
 soda generate fizz CreateIndexesOnRoomRestrictions
 10. We will also index (for fast lookup) by email or last_name in reservations. 
    And additionally a FK to room_restrictions (reservation_id)
 soda generate fizz AddFKAndIndicesToReservationsTable
